Computer Science 188 Introduction to Computer Vision at UCLA  
Fall 2019 
Scalzo

Introductory exposure to four Rs of computer vision. Reconstruction involves building model of 3D geometry of scene from images. Recognition is inferring semantics (identity and relations) among objects within scene from images. Rendering is inferring photometric properties of scenes, separating material properties from illumination, and generation of synthetic images. Regulation is inferring dynamics of objects in scenes, and using vision as sensor to control mobile assets within scene. Study of foundational models of image formation; basic image processing; and fundamentals of pattern recognition using deep learning, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs).
